# Unity-Streamed-Object
Need an easy system for setting up Level Streaming in Unity? The Unity Streamed Object script is a simple tool that can be coded to Load and Unload parts of a level depending on developer preferences!

#Installation
Simply extract the scripts of the Zip file to your project's Scripts!

#Usage
Simply use the Toolkit/Level Components/Streamed Object item in the top Menu of the Unity Editor, then make modifications to the Object that is created. You can use the Arrow in the Hierarchy to edit the object in the Prefab Editor, which grays out the rest of the world to focus on that part of the level. 

The Streamed Object script simply creates a simple interface for generating prefabs and loading/unloading them in your game. You can set a custom path for the saved Prefab for the Streamed Object in the Inspector of the Streamed Object.
